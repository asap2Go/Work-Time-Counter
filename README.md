# Work Time Counter
[![Go](https://github.com/asap2Go/WorkTimer/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asap2Go/WorkTimer/actions/workflows/build.yml)
Work Time Counter counts the time the user is active.
The counter will pause if the windows lock screen is active 
or the last user input is older than a specifiable timeout.
The counter can also be stopped and restarted manually.
The time worked can be copied in hh:mm format.
The app minimizes 2 seconds after startup into a system tray.
